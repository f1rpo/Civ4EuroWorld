This Earth scenario is work in progress; I'm uploading it mostly as a backup, though Europe, the Near East, India and two thirds of Africa are already playable. The scenario is optimized for the AdvCiv AI, but doesn't require any mod. I'm focusing on those regions of the world that can be best represented with the available civs, techs, terrain types etc., chiefly among them Europe. 

I'm using a custom map projection (see projection.jpg) designed to shrink unproductive areas and to reduce the distance between Mongolia and Europe in order to make a Mongolian Invasion feasible. The result has some resemblance to the Bonne projection. One downside is that Russia has no easy access to Alaska.

Installation:
Drop EuroWorld.CivBeyondSwordWBSave either into "AdvCiv\Private Maps" (if AdvCiv is installed) or into the BtS "Public Maps" folder.

Temporary measures:
* Free Calendar and Satellites for Tokugawa â€“ for immediate access to Globe view in testing.
* Free Polytheism, Code of Laws and Philosophy for Tokugawa in order to block three of the religions.
* Landmasses in the North Atlantic to prevent Barbarian cities from appearing on the British Isles all the time.

To be done:
* 7 more leaders. Only 4 of these are intended to be playable: Mao, Suryavarman, Genghis Khan, Tokugawa.
* Rules changes in AdvCiv that forbid Farms on Tundra and remove the health penalty from Jungle. Just to reduce implausible deforestation.
* Eventually, I'd like to reassign most of the leader traits in AdvCiv. E.g. Zara Yaqob would then lose the Creative trait. I might also swap in Cyrus after making his personality a bit more warlike.
* Possibly add more Barbarian cities in order to shape the early expansion of the civs; hopefully not necessary.
* Perhaps a file with text keys for more appropriate city names. I'm currently only using the stock names for portability.
* Perhaps per-tile designer notes
(see AdvCiv/Assets/XML/Text/Civ4GameText_Earth18Civs.xml for an example)

Further material:
* The Java program that I've used for generating the WBSave file.
* A screenshot from an all-AI game on the half-finished map. (Since then, India has been added.)
