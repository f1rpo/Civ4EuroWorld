This Earth scenario is work in progress; I'm uploading it mostly as a backup, though most of the Old World is already playable. The scenario is optimized for the AdvCiv AI, but doesn't require any mod. I'm focusing on those regions of the world that can be best represented with the available civs, techs, terrain types etc., chiefly among them Europe. 

I'm using a custom map projection (see projection.jpg) designed to shrink unproductive areas and to reduce the distance between Mongolia and Europe in order to make a Mongolian Invasion feasible. The result has some resemblance to the Bonne projection. One downside is that Russia has no easy access to Alaska.

Installation:
Drop EuroWorld.CivBeyondSwordWBSave either into "AdvCiv\Private Maps" (if AdvCiv is installed) or into the BtS "Public Maps" folder.

Temporary measures:
* Huayna Capac as a test player with free Calendar and Satellites for immediate access to Globe view.
* Landmasses in the North Atlantic to prevent Barbarian cities from appearing on the British Isles all the time.

To be done:
* America, Greenland, Southern Africa, Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia
* The three non-playable leaders: Shaka, Huayana Capac and Pacal
* Rules changes in AdvCiv that forbid Farms on Tundra and remove the health penalty from Jungle. To reduce implausible deforestation.
* Addition of an Islet feature (like in Realism Invictus).
* Changes to the AI evaluation of techs that found a religion. Especially leaders with a Medieval favorite religion like Charlemagne should avoid founding one of the early religons. Could then perhaps use Justinian instead of Pericles.
* Overhaul of leader personalities. I might swap in Qin for Mao after increasing Qin's peace-weight (pitting him against his warlike neighbors) and Cyrus for Darius after making Cyrus a bit more warlike. The Chinese leader also needs to be more averse to long-distance wars (higher MaxWarMinAdjacentLandPercent).
* Possibly add more Barbarian cities in order to shape the early expansion of the civs; hopefully not necessary.
* Perhaps a file with text keys for more appropriate city names. I'm currently only using the stock names for portability (and Asian names that are transcribed uniformly in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish).
* Perhaps per-tile designer notes
(see AdvCiv/Assets/XML/Text/Civ4GameText_Earth18Civs.xml for an example)

Perhaps to be revised:
* Charlemagne usually expands into Poland and often even into East Scandinavia. It might be better to replace Ragnar's England with Bismarck's Germany (starting at Berlin), covering all the Germanic peoples except - possibly - the British, and to move the Celtic capital from Prague to Paris and replace Charlemagne with the more Anglo-French De Gaulle. These changes may make it too difficult for Rome to expand, and would require a different resource distribution in the northern half of Europe and possibly changes to the coastline as well.
* Enlarging only the Eastern Sahara (for the Nile valley), but not the Western Sahara, was a bad idea. Additional desert tiles in the Western Sahara would make it harder for Mali to expand into North Africa, and probably wouldn't have any adverse side-effects.
* Similarly, Northern Siberia is more vertically compressed than it needs to be.

Further material:
* The Java program that I've used for generating the WBSave file.
* Two screenshots from all-AI games on the half-finished map. In between these two games, India, China, Indochina and Mongolia were added. And a third screenshot, taken at game start, after adding Japan and North Eastern Siberia.
